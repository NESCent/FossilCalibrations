To create a sample database, run 'FossilCalibration.sql'.

To migrate the schema in tandem with the code, run any visible migration
scripts in numeric order. Watch for 'TODO' notes in these scripts, since some
will involve changing filesystem paths or completing additional tasks to work
properly.

To install stored procedures (for node tree operations, etc), run
'stored-procedures.sql'.

NOTE that we're using MySQL version 5.0.7; older versions may require tweaks.
