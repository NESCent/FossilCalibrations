FossilCalibrations
==================

Synopsis
--------

The Fossil Calibrations database (FCD) supports the entry, sharing, and
retrieval of structured data associated with fossil calibration
dates. It is primarily designed and developed to house fossil
calibration dates associated with fossil calibration papers published
in the journal [Palaeontologia Electronica] (PE), following a set of
[best practices for publishing fossil calibrations]. These practices,
the database, and the special section in PE are products of the
NESCent working group [Synthesizing and databasing fossil calibrations:
divergence dating and beyond].

More details can be found on the [FCD Wiki].
